# 🧠 20 Logic-Focused Exercises using `char`, `string`, and Loops (C++)

## General Constraints
- Use loops (`for`, `while`)
- Analyze characters one by one using `char`
- Do NOT use library functions that directly solve the problem  
  (e.g. `length`, `size`, `find`, `reverse`, `toupper`, `tolower`, `count`)

---

### Exercise 1 – Manual Character Count
Read a string and determine how many characters it contains without using `.length()` or `.size()`.  
The count must be done by iterating character by character.

---

### Exercise 2 – Character Classification
Read a string and count how many characters are:
- letters
- digits
- spaces
- other symbols  
  Each character must be classified manually.

---

### Exercise 3 – Vowel and Consonant Count
Read a string and determine how many vowels and how many consonants it contains.  
Spaces and symbols must be ignored.

---

### Exercise 4 – Strict Palindrome Check
Determine whether a word is a palindrome by manually comparing characters from both ends.  
Reversing the string or using helper functions is not allowed.

---

### Exercise 5 – Manual String Reversal
Reverse a string character by character using loops.  
Creating a second auxiliary string is not allowed.

---

### Exercise 6 – Character-by-Character String Comparison
Read two strings and determine whether they are equal by comparing each character manually.  
Direct string comparison operators are not allowed.

---

### Exercise 7 – Character Frequency
Read a string and a character, then determine how many times that character appears in the string.

---

### Exercise 8 – Space Removal
Read a sentence and display the same sentence without any spaces, manually shifting characters.

---

### Exercise 9 – Word Count
Determine how many words exist in a sentence, considering that words are separated by one or more consecutive spaces.

---

### Exercise 10 – Manual Uppercase Conversion
Convert a string to uppercase without using library functions, by analyzing the ASCII value of each character.

---

### Exercise 11 – Manual Lowercase Conversion
Convert a string to lowercase using only character logic and loops.

---

### Exercise 12 – Controlled Character Replacement
Read a string and replace all occurrences of a given character with another one, using manual traversal.

---

### Exercise 13 – Digit Detection in Text
Determine whether a string contains at least one numeric digit.

---

### Exercise 14 – Digit Count
Count how many numeric characters exist in a string.

---

### Exercise 15 – Longest Word Detection
Read a sentence and determine which word is the longest by analyzing characters and using counters.

---

### Exercise 16 – Word-by-Word Reversal
Reverse each word in a sentence without changing the order of the words.

---

### Exercise 17 – Duplicate Character Removal
Remove duplicate characters from a string, keeping only the first occurrence of each character.

---

### Exercise 18 – Password Validation
Validate a password according to the following rules:
- at least one uppercase letter
- at least one lowercase letter
- at least one digit
- no spaces allowed  
  All checks must be done using character analysis.

---

### Exercise 19 – Alphabetical Order Check
Determine whether the characters in a string are sorted in ascending alphabetical order.

---

### Exercise 20 – Anagram Detection
Determine whether two strings are anagrams by comparing the frequency of each character, without using advanced data structures.
